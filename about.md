At some point in my life, I gave a lot of thought to these people and their ideas:

* Peter Thiel ([Mimesis](http://www.imitatio.org/); [technological progress as a moral imperative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsXFwy6gG_4))
* Agnes Callard ([Proleptic reasons](https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/philosophy/prod/2019-06/Callard%20Proleptic%20Reasons%20Final%20Published%20Version%20OSME.pdf); [aspiration](https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/philosophy/prod/2018-09/Aspiration%20final%20ms.%20UV.pdf))
* Richard Feynman ([Curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmTmGLzPVyM); [sense of awe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA))
* Friedrich Hayek ([Cultural evolution](https://www.docdroid.net/n8mk5H9/the-three-sources-of-human-values-pdf); [the use of knowledge in society](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html))
* Karl Popper ([Critical rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism); [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance))
* Nassim Taleb ([Antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility); [optionality](https://25iq.com/2013/10/13/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-nassim-taleb-about-optionalityinvesting/))
* Naval Ravikant ([Autodidacticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmBoU93TRlo); [life fulfillment](https://youtu.be/X7tnoR6a-8A))


There are two quotes that have stuck with me for years.

Karl Ove Knausgaard, in Book Six of his series _My Struggle_:
> Charisma is one of the two great transcendental forces in the social world: beauty is the other.  They are forces seldom talked about, since both issue from the individual, neither may be learned or acquired, and in a democracy, where everyone is meant to be considered equal and where all relationships are meant to be just, such properties cannot be accorded value, though all of us are aware of them and of how much they mean…beauty eclipses everything, bedims all else, it is what we see first and what we consciously or unconsciously seek.  Yet this phenomenon is shrouded in silence…driving it out instead by our social mechanisms of expulsion, calling it stupid, immature, or unsophisticated, perhaps even primitive, at the same time as we allow it to flourish in the commercial domain, where it quietly surrounds us whichever way we turn…

Ayn Rand, writing to a fan in 1960:[^1]
> You ask me about the meaning of the dialogue on page 702 of Atlas Shrugged:  
> 
> "'We never had to take any of it seriously, did we?" she whispered. "'No, we never had to.'"  
> 
> Let me begin by saying that this is perhaps the most important point in the whole book, because it is the condensed emotional summation, the keynote or leitmotif, of the view of life presented in Atlas Shrugged.  
> 
> What Dagny expresses here is the conviction that joy, exaltation, beauty, greatness, heroism, all the supreme, uplifting values of man's existence on earth, are the meaning of life—not the pain or ugliness he may encounter—that one must live for the sake of such exalted moments as one may be able to achieve or experience, not for the sake of suffering—that happiness matters, but suffering does not—that no matter how much pain one may have to endure, it is never to be taken seriously, that is: never to be taken as the essence and meaning of life—that the essence of life is the achievement of joy, not the escape from pain. The issue she refers to is the basic philosophical issue which John Galt later names explicitly in his speech: that the most fundamental division among men is between those who are pro-man, pro-mind, pro-life—and those who are anti-man, anti-mind, anti-life.  
> 
> It is the difference between those who think that man's life is important and that happiness is possible—and those who think that man's life, by its very nature, is a hopeless, senseless tragedy and that man is a depraved creature doomed to despair and defeat. It is the difference between those whose basic motive is the desire to achieve values, to experience joy—and those whose basic motive is the desire to escape from pain, to experience a momentary relief from their chronic anxiety and guilt.  
> 
> It is a matter of one's fundamental, overall attitude toward life—not of any one specific event. So you see that your interpretation was too specific and too narrow; besides, the Looters' World had never meant anything to Dagny and she had realized its "sham and hypocrisy" long before. What she felt, in that particular moment, was the confirmation of her conviction that an ideal man and an ideal form of existence are possible.
