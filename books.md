I love stumbling on [other people's reading lists](#otherlists), and this page is a list of my own favorites. I also keep a log on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61944802-dan-schulz).

**Favorites**
Adams, _Watership Down_. Ostensibly a children's story, but really a meditation on what it means to be good. Mysticism, friendship, freedom and totalitarianism, fertility, love, war.

Bolano, _The Savage Detectives_ and _2666_. There's a darkness in Bolano's novels that looms over every page but never reveals itself. Like there's a ghost in the room with you. Strange and unlike any other reading experience. Borges' influence is obvious.

Borges, _Ficciones_. Fantastic stories that are worth a lifetime of re-reading. 

Sledge, _With the Old Breed_. War memoir that refuses to glorify any of the horror.

Sebald, _Austerlitz_

Ferrante, _The Neapolitan Novels_

Houellebecq, _Submission_

Zweig, _The World of Yesterday_

Henrich, _The Secret of our Success_

Pesssoa, _The Book of Disquiet_

Murakami, _Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World_

Wallace, _Consider the Lobster and other Essays_

Chiang, _Stories of your Life and Others_

Hofstadter, _Gödel, Escher, Bach_

Taleb, _Antifragile_

Cowen, _Stubborn Attachments_

Dawkins, _The Selfish Gene_

Mitchell, _Number9Dream_
