I love stumbling on [other people's reading lists](#otherlists), and this page is a list of my own favorites. I also keep a log on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61944802-dan-schulz).

**The best**

Bolano, _The Savage Detectives_ and _2666_. My favorite author. His two big novels are the best and worth every bit of effort.

Borges, _Ficciones_. These stories are the easiest way to describe my taste in fiction. Philosophical literature with layers and layers of meaning that rewards rereading. Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius is my favorite, but I come back to all of them frequently.

Adams, _Watership Down_. A story about rabbits that says profound things about friendship, mythology, fertility, totalitarianism, and more.

Sebald, _Austerlitz_. Sebald without question writes the most beautiful prose I've had the pleasure of reading.

Zweig, _The World of Yesterday_. A literary memoir and first person take on what it was like to watch the world get obliterated in the first half of the twentieth century. A reminder that history can reset itself in a single generation.

Henrich, _The Secret of our Success_. A readable introduction to cultural evolution and my favorite book that you might call "big history." More rigorous than _Sapiens_; _Guns, Germs, and Steel_; and the like.

Chiang, _Stories of your Life and Others_ and _Exhalation_. Like Borges, Chiang writes knock out speculative fiction. Less literary and heavier on the sci-fi.

Wallace, _Consider the Lobster and other Essays_. When I was a teenager I'd Google "highest IQ person ever" and was always surprised to find Goethe alongside the likes of John von Neumann. Well, these essays taught me that verbal dexterity can be just as impressive as multiplying eight digit numbers in your head.

Houellebecq, _Submission_. Houellebecq is the author most responsible for getting me hooked on fiction, and Submission is the one I started with. Satirical, hilarious, and a little Straussian.

Ferrante, _The Neapolitan Novels_. 

Pesssoa, _The Book of Disquiet_ 

Sledge, _With the Old Breed_

Murakami, _Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World_

Hofstadter, _Gödel, Escher, Bach_

Taleb, _Antifragile_

Cowen, _Stubborn Attachments_

Dawkins, _The Selfish Gene_

Mitchell, _Number9Dream_
