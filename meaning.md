As I'm sure many do, I think excessively about the meaning of life. I don't believe there is an answer, but there are people who have written pieces that point in the right direction. Here are a few of my favorites:

- [Scott Summner, "Wallowing in nostalgia (an autobiography)"](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/wallowing-in-nostalgia-an-autobiography/)
- [Scott Sumner, "What do we mean by meaning?"](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/what-do-we-mean-by-meaning/)
- [Simon Boas, "Iâ€™m sorry to have to announce that my cancer situation has developed not necessarily to my advantage"](https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2024/02/11/jersey-overseas-aid-director-simon-boas-discusses-his-terminal-cancer-diagnosis/)
- [Matt Lakeman, "Thoughts on Meaning and Writing"](https://mattlakeman.org/2020/10/06/thoughts-on-meaning-and-writing/)
