I have a strongly held view that life optimizations are mostly a waste of time. Cold showers, the perfect workout routine, athletic greens, meditation, etc. are worth focusing on relative to other improvements you can make. If you want to improve at anything 95%+ of the problem is to just work harder.

- If you want to get in better shape, workout harder for longer.
- If you want to do better at work, work more on the highest priorities things. It's always tempting to put off the most challenging work because of the [ugh field](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields). Just do the work now and spend 50-200% mroe time on it than you were planning to.
- Sleep is important, but the best way to get more sleep is to stop procrastinating on your work during the day so you have 7-8 hours in bed. The first problem is the 30 minutes spent that day on Twitter or Netflix, not your tracking device.
