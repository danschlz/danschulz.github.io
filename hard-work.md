I believe obsessively optimizing your life is a waste of time. Cold showers, a calculated workout routine, athletic greens, meditating, etc. are not going to solve your problems. Working harder will.

- Sleep is important, but the best way to get more sleep is to stop procrastinating on your work during the day so you have 7-8 hours in bed. The real problem spending 30 minutes or more on Twitter or Netflix.
