In 2025 I started tracking albums I've listened to all the way through at [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/collection/dnsz/ss.rd). These are some of the playlists I keep going back to or currently have on repeat:

I got addicted to classical music in 2024 and consider it to be one of the most emotionally rewarding discoveries of my life. The pieces that got me hooked were Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20, K. 466, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, Op. 58, and Beethoven's Waldstein Sonata, Op. 53 (esp. the third movement). Robert Greenberg's [How to Listen to and Understand Great Music](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Listen-to-and-Understand-Great-Music-3rd-Edition-Audiobook/B00DDVQIM2), the [Sticky Notes podcast](https://stickynotespodcast.libsyn.com/), and the /r/classicalmusic subreddit have been great resources.
