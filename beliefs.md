Some beliefs

- Spending time talking about how other people are wrong is a huge waste of time and makes you unhappy, but more importantly it redirects you away from one of the most fruitful uses of your time: understanding ideas you disagree with. For example, if you call yourself a libertarian, you will learn 10x more writing an essay defending Marxism than you will pointing out reasons it is wrong. If you're a techno-optimist, read Ted Kaczynski, and take him seriously. 
- Where you live matters a lot, all the way down to the street corners. In cities you spend a huge amount of time within a 10 minute walkl of your apartment and your day to day experience from someone on the other side of the town will be much different. For me being a short distance from work, a gym, the water, and a good grocery store make my daily experience much better. People sort of know this, but I think it's underrated.
