[Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/tools-gear/) and [José Luis Ricón](https://nintil.com/1-stuff-i-own-and-use/) have similar posts that I enjoyed, so here is mine.

Software

I am a software tool minimalist and prefer the defaults wherever possible.

Apple Notes. I keep a running list of ideas anytime a thought pops into my head that I want to remember.

Day One. Daily journal.

MyFitnessPal. I track my calories whenever I eat at home. I'm not religious about it and for example do not track any food I eat at restaurants or when I'm out of the house, but still find it very useful to track the food I eat at home especially because it helps me build an intuition about what foods are outsized contributors to eating too much in a day.

Things. To-do app. I've considered switching this completely into Google Tasks or my drafts folder in GMail to reduce the number of apps I use but haven't got around to it yet.

Chrome + Gmail. I use the drafts folder in GMmail as a secondary to-do list.

PocketCasts. Podcast app.


Stuff

Clothing. Banana Republic is by far the best value. The factory site frequently has items 50-75% off and you can buy e.g. a nice sweater for under $30.
